# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Little neural networks project that implements Handwritten Digit Recognition by Deep Learning  
This repo consist of the old project (that I did on around 01.09.2024) and the new optimized project that I am currently working on.  
The code is very lightweight and there is a lot of descriptions of code blocks.  
Hope someone interested in the fundamentals of neural networks find this little implementation useful ! ! !
